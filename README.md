# CODSOFT :TASK 1 :


# 🎬 Movie Genre Classification

This project focuses on building a machine learning model that can classify the **genre of a movie** based on its **title and plot description**. The system uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques and classic machine learning algorithms to predict genres effectively.

---

## 🧠 Task

**Goal:** Predict the genre of a movie from its plot summary and title using machine learning models.

---

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset contains the following columns:

- `TITLE`: The title of the movie.
- `DESCRIPTION`: A brief plot summary of the movie.
- `GENRE`: The target label — the movie's genre.

Train and test CSV files are used:
- `output_dataset.csv` – for training/validation.
- `out_dataset.csv` – for testing.
- `outsol_dataset.csv` – ground truth for test set.

---

## ⚙️ Models Used

1. **Naive Bayes (GaussianNB)**
2. **Logistic Regression**
3. **Support Vector Machine (SVM - LinearSVC)**

TF-IDF vectorization was applied to the combined movie title and description to extract textual features.

---

## 🔁 Workflow

1. **Preprocessing:**
   - Combined `TITLE` and `DESCRIPTION` into a single `text` column.
   - Applied TF-IDF vectorization (max features = 5000).

2. **Training:**
   - Models were trained on 80% of the data and validated on 20%.

3. **Evaluation:**
   - Accuracy scores were computed for each model on both training and test splits.
   - Final predictions were compared with the ground truth labels.

---

## 📊 Results

| Model               | Train Accuracy | Test Accuracy |
|--------------------|----------------|---------------|
| GaussianNB          | 0.656          | 0.419         |
| Logistic Regression | 0.986          | 0.825         |
| Linear SVM          | 1.000          | 0.826         |

> The SVM and Logistic Regression models significantly outperformed Naive Bayes in accuracy.

   ```

---

## 📌 Notes

- For better fraud detection, consider techniques like SMOTE for handling class imbalance, or try neural network models for more advanced learning.
- Real-time fraud detection systems often require model deployment and integration with transaction streams.
